    """Compute recurrence coefficients for orthogonal polynomials using Gautschi's method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z : ndarray of shape (n,)
        Support points (e.g., abscissas of the discrete measure).
    w : ndarray of shape (n,)
        Non-negative weights associated with the support points.
    n_iter : int
        Number of recurrence coefficients (polynomial degrees) to compute.

    Returns
    -------
    a : ndarray of shape (n_iter,)
        Diagonal recurrence coefficients (also called alpha).
    b : ndarray of shape (n_iter - 1,)
        Subdiagonal recurrence coefficients (also called beta).

    Notes
    -----
    This function implements the discrete version of the three-term recurrence
    relation used to generate orthogonal polynomials with respect to a discrete
    inner product:

        ⟨f, g⟩ = ∑ w_i f(z_i) g(z_i)

    using the algorithm of Gautschi (1982). The polynomials are not returned,
    only the recurrence coefficients `a` and `b` such that:
